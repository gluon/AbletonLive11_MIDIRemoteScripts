InstantMappings HowTo
========================================================

With the file 'UserConfiguration.txt' provided in this
directory, you can create your own InstantMappings.

Note: You can solely map the given features to your
      Control Surface. You can neither add features
      nor can you change the banks of device parameters.


1. Create a directory in 'User Remote Scripts'. The name
   of the directory will show up in the list of
   Control Surfaces in Live.

   Naming: The name of the directory should start with
   a letter (not a number or special character such as '_').

2. Copy the the file 'UserConfiguration.txt' into your
   directory. The name of the file needs to remain
   unchanged.

3. Edit the copy to adapt it to your needs. The comments
   in the file will tell you what to do.  You can find
   some additional information on this subject in the
   following articles:
